# CSC 481 Game Engine
This repository includes the game engine created for CSC 481 and eventually will hold four games built using that engine. Currently there is a game based on Alchemy and another based on Snake.

## Setup
You can either: 
* Use GitHub Pages at [https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/nmcgove/NotAlchemy/](https://pages.github.ncsu.edu/nmcgove/NotAlchemy/). 
* Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

Choose a game from one of the buttons. If using Chrome, you may have to allow cross origin requests for files as this is usually disabled.
